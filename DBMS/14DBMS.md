### **14. Advanced Topics in Databases**

---

#### **1. Data Warehousing and Data Mining**

1. **Data Warehousing**:
   - A centralized repository for storing integrated data from multiple sources.
   - Used for reporting and data analysis.
   - Example: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery.

2. **Data Mining**:
   - The process of discovering patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data.
   - Techniques: Classification, clustering, association rule mining.

#### **2. Big Data and Hadoop**

1. **Big Data**:
   - Refers to extremely large datasets that cannot be processed using traditional methods.
   - Characteristics: Volume, Velocity, Variety.

2. **Hadoop**:
   - An open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of big data.
   - Components: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), MapReduce.

#### **3. Cloud Databases**

1. **Cloud Databases**:
   - Databases hosted on cloud platforms.
   - Benefits: Scalability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness.
   - Example: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL.

2. **Database as a Service (DBaaS)**:
   - A cloud service that provides database functionality without the need for physical hardware.
   - Example: Amazon Aurora, Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

#### **4. Blockchain and Databases**

1. **Blockchain**:
   - A decentralized and distributed ledger technology.
   - Used for secure and transparent transactions.
   - Example: Bitcoin, Ethereum.

2. **Blockchain Databases**:
   - Combine blockchain technology with traditional databases.
   - Benefits: Immutability, transparency, security.

#### **5. Temporal Databases**

1. **Temporal Databases**:
   - Store and manage time-varying data.
   - Example: Tracking historical changes in employee salaries.

---

#### **6. Spatial Databases**

1. **Spatial Databases**:
   - Store and manage spatial data (e.g., maps, geographic information).
   - Example: PostGIS, Oracle Spatial.

---

### **Summary**

- **Data Warehousing and Data Mining**: Centralized repositories and pattern discovery.
