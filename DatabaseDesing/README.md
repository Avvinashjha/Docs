# Database Design

Databse desing is a process of creating a detailed blueprint for organizing, storing, and managing data in a database. The goal of databse design is to create a system that ensures `data itegrity`, `mimizes redundancy`, `support scalablity`, and f`aciliates efficient querring`.

## Key Stages of Database Design

1. Requirement Analysis
    - Understand the products needs
    - Identify the types of data to be stored
        - relationship between data entities
        - How user will interact with data
    - Gather non-functional requirements
        - performance
        - security
        - scalablity

2. Conceptual Desing
    - Create a high-level representation of datastructure using ER model
    - Define Entities (customers, orders), attributes (costomer name, order date) and relationship (one to many, many to many)
    - Focus on logical organization of data without worrying about implementation

3. Logical Design
    - Translate the conseptual model into a logical schema using a specific models, such as relational, hirarchical, or object-oriented
    - In relational databse this envolves defining, Tables, columns, primary key, forieign key and constraints
    - Ensure data is normalized, eliminate redundancy, maitain data integrity

4. Physical Design
    - Determine how the logical schema will be implemented in the choosen DBMS
    - Optimize storage structure
    - Consider Harwared Limitation, Querry Patterns and access methods

5. Implementation
    - Create Database Schema
    - Populate DB with initial Data
    - Test Database for functionality, performance, and security

6. Maintenance and Optimization
    - Monitor the databse for issue like bottleneck and data anomilies
    - Refine the design based on evolving requirements
    - Regularly update indexes, statistics and queries for optimal performance

## Core Principles of Database Design
1. **Normalization**: A systematic approach to organizing data to reduce redundancy and dependency
2. **Data integrity**: Ensure accuracy and consistancy of data through contarints like primary key, foreign key, unique contraints and check conditions
3. **Scalablity**: Design the databse to handle growth in data volumes and user load without significant degradtion in performance
4. **Security**: Protect sensitive data through access control, encryption and auditing
5. **Performance**: Optimze queries, indexes, and storage structures to ensure fast data retrieval and updates.
