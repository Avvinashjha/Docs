# 3. Component Architecture & State Management

Goal: Explain how to structure and scale apps.

Lifting state up vs prop drilling

Context API vs Redux vs Zustand vs Jotai vs Recoil

Global vs local state

Immutable state patterns

Derived state & memoization

State normalization

Form state management (Formik, React Hook Form)

Handling async state (React Query, SWR)

Handling side effects and data fetching

Suspense for data fetching
